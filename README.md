# BallVisionSCAI

🧠 Project Title: AI-Powered Football Match Performance Analysis System
📌 Overview
This project introduces an AI-driven system for analyzing football match performance, tailored to support local clubs and academies with accessible, high-precision insights. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning, the system transforms recorded match videos into tactical and physical data—reducing reliance on expensive manual analysis and enhancing decision-making for coaches and analysts.

⚠️ Note: This project is under active development. Some features are still being implemented and may not be fully functional yet.
